# Tred's Adventure: Game Specs
by JiffyRob and zclimb

### Full Synopsis
Tred's Adventure is a top-down game with the goals being:

 - Immersive Environment
 - Gripping, deep world building
 - Terrible Puns throughout
 - Plenty of eccentric, lovable, and stupid characters
 - Game should make you groan and laugh
 - Game should take plenty of time to complete
 - Game should have simple robust code
 - Maps should be open, dungeons maze like
 - Plenty of odd gimmicks to puzzle around with
 - Assortment of interesting weapons with odd effects
 - Items should be something easily attenable and usable (there should be a variety of them)
 - Believable, somewhat farcicial, somewhat serious plot
 - Environment should appear as 3d as possible without being truly 3d

## List of Mechanics (Current-ish)
 - Advanced Map Loading (Animated tiles, flexible layers, etc.)
 - Player motion
 - basic collision
 - simple pause memu
 - fullscreen toggle-able
 - high level scripting (eg JSON script that can do literally anything that I allow in the API.  Will be used for complex story progressions later)
 
## List of future Mechanics
 - many terrains that affect the player in different ways
 - enemies + combat
 - day/night
 - throwable objects
 - npcs
 - lucite crystal components (a magical crystal a little like Minecraft's redstone, but 2d and less powerful)
 - particle effects
 - map changing based on tiled worlds
 - usable items + item menu
 - health, HUD
